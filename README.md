# LIgeodesics
Left invariant geodesics on Lie groups.


Matlab tools for computing Left (or Right) invariant geodesics on different common Lie groups. The geodesics are implemented as the Riemannian Exponential funcion under left-(right-)invariant metrics defined in the Lie algebra.

For some well-known groups, *closed-form* expressions are used when it is possible.

Riemannian logarithm funtions are also provided.
